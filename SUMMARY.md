**Electric Pole** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 75 images with 108 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*pole*).

Each image in the Electric Pole dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (8 images), *valid* (15 images), and *train* (52 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Ritsumeikan University, Japan](https://en.ritsumei.ac.jp/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
